Basic usage
-------------------
This directory is part of a simple hack made to keep a vanilla CNTLM setup sync'ed
with the current NetworkManager status.

It's kinda simple: Just put here (in the directory you found this file) a text file,
using a name like 'your-connection-on-nm.conf', containing the cntlm.conf config
snippet specific to your domain, and voílà! Next time your network interface status
change, the right cntlm.conf will be used!

- "Cool, but wait.... How will I know the right name to use on this file?"
Simple! Just run the command line below, and check:

$ nmcli connection

- "Nice, but I just want to know my current connection's name.... How do I?"
Use this command, so:

$ nmcli -t -f NAME connection status

- "Yeah! Gotcha! But: how do I config the sanippet-like-file for my domain?"
To be cristal clear, nothing like an example. Think we are working on a project at
a client site, which is proxied. Think the IT staff granted us acces to their wifi,
but hey: it has a proxy! No worries: let's just follow these few steps, and let the
party begin:

1. Connect to the network using nm-applet, as you normally do. If your network is an
   Ethernet, give it a unique name (how? man nm-settings). For this example's sake,
   let's say our network was named "Client Network" (w/o the quotes, obviously ¬¬).

2. Create a file here (on this same directory, duh...) with the name of your network:

$ vim /etc/cntlm.conf.d/Client\ Network.conf

   [Did you notice that scaped space on the file name? Good boy.]

3. On the file body, fill up the needed config (notice there's no 'Listen' keyword):
#===================================================================================#
| Username        yourusername
| Domain          YOURDOMAIN
| Auth            NTLM2SR
| PassNTLMv2      18F337B0FED7D69B0BB52215E7D5FE29
| Proxy           proxy.client.com:80
| NoProxy         localhost, 127.0.0.*, 10.*, 192.168.*, 172.*
|
| -- INSERTING --
#===================================================================================#
   ["Dude, your vim mock-up rocks!" Thanks. Didn't get it? Read man cntlm.]

4. Just reconnect your "Client Network" and browse.

You are welcome.

Technical stuff
-------------------
So you want to learn the magic? Don't worry: I'm a good guy, so I'll tell you:
Look at the following script: /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/02cntlm
